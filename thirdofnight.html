            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to provide a simple, accurate, and ad-free prayer companion for Muslims worldwide. 
                We aim to help users stay connected to their night worship, with a special focus on Midnight and 
                the Last Third of the Night. The app is built to facilitate a smooth and spiritual end to the day 
                by reciting Surah Al-Mulk and keeping track of the most blessed times of the night.
            </p>

            <h2>Application Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Night Prayers was created to address the need for a privacy-first, distraction-free application 
                that focuses solely on providing accurate prayer times for Midnight and the Last Third of the Night. 
                Our goal is to help Muslims strengthen their spiritual connection before sleep and maintain the 
                important practice of reciting Surah Al-Mulk.
